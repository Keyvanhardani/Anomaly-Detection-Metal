# Anomaly Detection for Metal Parts in Production üè≠üîß

This repository demonstrates an anomaly detection system for identifying defects in metal parts during production lines using **OpenVINO** and **Deep Learning**. The model detects anomalies such as scratches or deformations in real time.

---

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Automatically prepares input images for the model.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Generates heatmaps and segmentation masks to highlight defects.
- **Visualization**: Saves output images and anomaly maps for further inspection.

## Performance Metrics
- **Image AUROC**: 0.95
- **Image F1 Score**: 0.94
- **Pixel AUROC**: 0.96
- **Pixel F1 Score**: 0.71
